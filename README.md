# Art hacks

This is a repository of ugly hacks that create nice pictures for me.
I don't expect this to be of any use to anyone else.

## Ydin

[Ydin](http://aaltoliike.aalto.fi/index.php/portfolio/ydin/) is an upcycled paper sculpture. I cut the pages of some photoelectric conference proceedings with a paper knife and arranged them into seven sheets of roughly 80cm * 80cm.

Ydin was on display at [Habitare 2015](http://www.habitare.fi/) in Messukeskus, Helsinki as part of a student exhibition called Edited. Edited featured upcycled book art from 7 Aalto University students.

## Kuukuosi

As seen on Reddit ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gonwild/comments/6wxgg4/my_hole/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/loadingicon/comments/6x1ly3/oc_shining_hole_xpost_from_rgonwild/))

## Zen coloring

Horribly inefficient Javascript code that generates black-and-white line drawings in the style of 'zen coloring' books
